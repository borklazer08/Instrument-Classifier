# Instrument-Classifier
A lot of the files were redundant and used for experimentation so I chose not to include them . To recreate the obtained results:
1. "Basic_NN_Solve_overfit" , "CNN", "RNN LSTM" contain final configurations of networks post hyperparametertuning.
2. download JSON file as it contains preprocessed dataset.
3.Change directory in load_dataset funstion to where you have downloaded it.
4.Run. The script will compile and test the model and return all metrics and graphs used in the study.
